# Refinery CMS Product Specs

Product specs engine for [Refinery CMS](http://refinerycms.com) allows you to add specs when using the products plugin.


## Developing & Contributing

The version of Refinery to develop this engine against is defined in the gemspec. To override the version of refinery to develop against, edit the project Gemfile to point to a local path containing a clone of refinerycms.

### Testing

Generate the dummy application to test against

    $ bundle exec rake refinery:testing:dummy_app

Run the test suite with [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)

    $ bundle exec guard start

Or just with rake spec

    $ bundle exec rake spec
